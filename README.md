# Personal Website

This is the codebase for my personal website, deployed at [mattcadena.com](https://mattcadena.com). The site showcases my portfolio, projects, and experience, highlighting both my technical skills and design abilities.

## Overview

I leveraged my experience from my 2024 software engineering internship at Ford Motor Company to craft this dynamic website using modern frontend technologies. The site is built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, and it features animations powered by **Framer Motion** and **GSAP**.

### Key Features:
- **State Management**: Utilized **Jotai** for efficient state management, inspired by patterns and techniques I applied during my internship.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Integrated **Framer Motion** and **GSAP** to create a smooth, interactive, and visually appealing user experience.
- **Hosting**: The website is deployed using **AWS**.
